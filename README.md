Write a program for an automatic teller machine that dispenses money.

The user should enter the amount desired (a multiple of 10 dollars) and the machine dispenses this amount using the least number of bills. The bills dispensed are 50s, 20s and 10s.

Write a separate function of type void that accepts the amount to dispense and returns the number of bills for each denomination.
